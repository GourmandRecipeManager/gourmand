  bug-checking before release)
* Fixed generic web import.

* Fix bug that broke changing the shopping category of an ingredient
  from within the ingredient editing view.
* Fix traceback when filling ingredient-editor from a unitless
  ingredient.
* Fix problem with recipe-links not working when they contained
  unicode (such as the unicode for 1/2, 1/4, etc.)
* Make page-chooser in edit-view highlight the first page when we open
  a new recipe card. Otherwise, the function of the widget is unclear.

==== Version 0.11.0 changes since 0.10.1 ====

* Fix ingredient editing so that changes are no longer automatically
  committed to the DB. Now the ingredient tab of the recipe edit window
  works like everything else, with a standard "save" model.
* While we're at it, we prevent crashes from happening.

* Fix bug causing "None" to show up in shopping list when there is no
  unit.
* Fix popup menus throughout.

==== Version 0.10.0 changes cince 0.9.0.3 ====
* Switch database backend to SQLite. The backend is still abstract, so
  if in the future someone wants to switch back to metakit or to
  something else, it should be simple.
* Add new automated backup script into setup.py. This is less than
  ideal, but there's no real way to import smoothly from the old system
  to the new.
* Make editing of recipe card a separate dialog from viewing recipe
  card. This allows the recipe card itself to lose the toolbar and look
  much cleaner.
* Make text in recipe card reflow properly when resizing.
* Improve import speed drastically by not inserting auto-generated
  keys into key table.
* Only add keys to ingkey table (used for automatic key-guessing) when
  the user has modified something. This means we actually learn from the
  user rather than generating our own random noise.
* Add support for typing "or" in a search instead of using the or bar (|).
* Import sorting of USDA DB searches (in the nutritional info druid)
  to bring you better results faster.
* Many, many more bugfixes along the way.

==== Version 0.8.6.2 Changes since 0.8.6.1 ====

  Gourmet. This makes just about everything "feel" faster -- startup,
  search, etc.

==== Version 0.8.6.1 Changes since 0.8.6.0 ====
* Database normalized; hopefully this will mean performance improvements
* Oodles of magic added to aid normalization of DB
* Key lookup improved / interface on recipe card should be less sluggish.
* ComboBoxEntry's changed so that one TAB moves focus out of them -- this
  should improve e.g. recipe entry though it does break consistency with
  other GTK apps.

==== Version 0.8.6.0 Changes since 0.8.5.x ====
* Changed database format for greater efficiency/speed.
* Times (cook/prep) are now stored internally as numbers of seconds,
  which means sorting just works
* Ratings are now done one a star-system, which means sorting just
  works.
* since ratings are done on a star system, we've introduced a dialog
  to let the user select how they'd like to translate textual ratings
  into stars

==== Version 0.8.5.12 Changes since 0.8.5.11 ====
